## SiDG-ATRID
### Simulator for Data Generation - for Automatic Target Recognition, Identification and Detection

a simulation platform that enables the collection of high-fidelity imagery data, powered by Unreal Engine 5. The simulator supports multi-agent simulations using the AirSim API library for UAV controls and simulates commercial aircraft traffic. This framework allows for customized camera placements to record videos or photos and manage environmental conditions such as weather and lighting. Additionally, by leveraging the Cesium API for geospatial mapping, it can accurately recreate real-world environments, enhancing the realism and applicability of simulations. This integrated approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of synthetic data generation for detection tasks, enabling developers to easily configure simulations and collect diverse data.
